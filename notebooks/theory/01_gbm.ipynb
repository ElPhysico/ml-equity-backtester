    "# Intuitive approach to modeling stock prices\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we were trying to figure out how to mathematically model the movement of stock prices. To start, it could help to look at cash equivalents.\\\n",
    "How does cash evolve under time? Given an interest rate or *risk-free rate* $r$, we may know that our cash amount grows by $r$ every year.\\\n",
    "More generally, we can define a rate $r$ per any time unit $dt$, and if $X$ denotes the amount of cash we have, the amount of cash we receive per time unit is given by $dX$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dX = r X dt.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This notation style is chosen on purpose, because it makes it easier to recognize the equation as a differential equation.\\\n",
    "After separating the variables ($X$ and $t$), this equation can be easily integrated and we achieve the very well known exponential compounding for cash:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X(t) = X_0 e^{rt}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Going back to stocks, we could make the assumption that stocks also grow at a constant rate per time unit and simply use the above result. But that's not very realistic.\\\n",
    "To make it more realistic, we need to add some fluctuations:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "dS = \\mu S dt + \\sigma S dW,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where now $S$ is the stock price, $\\mu$ is a constant growth rate, $dW$ are small fluctuations, and $\\sigma$ is a scaling factor. Note that fluctuations are scaled to current stock price.\\\n",
    "How should these fluctuations $dW$ look like? A good approach is to choose random fluctuations or rather a stochastic process. A common choice is the **Wiener process** $W$.\\\n",
    "So let's try to integrate this equation again."

    "### The Wiener process and why classical integration fails\n",
    "\n",
    "At first sight, the equation $\\dfrac{dS}{S} = \\mu dt + \\sigma dW$ seems like it should be integratable as we know it. However, the stochastic nature of the equation brings complexity.\\\n",
    "A sufficient condition to use the Riemann-Stieltjes integral is that the integrator, here $W$, is of *bounded variation*, which means $W$ needs to have finite total variation. And this is exactly the problem.\\\n",
    "Let's look at the total variation of $W$ over the interval $[0, T]$. We partition the interval into $n$ equidistant subintervals of length $\\Delta t = T/n$. The total variation is then:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(W) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} |\\Delta W_i| = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} | W((i+1)\\Delta t) - W(i \\Delta t)|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Now a defining property of the Wiener process is that its increments are Gaussian distributed $W((i+1)\\Delta t) - W(i \\Delta t) \\propto \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Delta t) = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. We can use that and get:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(W) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{\\Delta t}\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} |Z_i|,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $Z_i$ are independent and identical distributed standard normal distributions. We insert a multiplicative 1 and use the strong law of large numbers:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(W) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{\\Delta t}n \\left(\\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} |Z_i|\\right) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{\\Delta t}n E[|Z|] = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{\\Delta t}n \\sqrt{\\dfrac{2}{\\pi}} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sqrt{Tn}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{2}{\\pi}} \\to \\infty\n",
    "$$\n",
    "And now the problem is already apparent: as we make the partition finer ($n \\to \\infty$), the total variation $V$ is infinite (growing as $\\sqrt{n}$) and thus, we cannot apply the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, specifically\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int dW \\neq W + c,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "in the Riemann-Stieltjes sense. This itself is not a problem as It么's calculus lets us solve this integral. Where it becomes tricky is the part $\\int \\sigma S dW$, as here, integrator and integrand depend on the same stochastic process. \\\n",
    "To solve this issue we can either use It么's Lemma, or we can use a little trick (which boils down to It么's Lemma). Since we can't directly integrate $\\dfrac{dS}{S} = \\mu dt + \\sigma dW$, let's look at $d\\ln{S}$, that is a small increment of $\\ln{S}$. We use the Taylor expansion:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d\\ln{S} = \\dfrac{1}{S} dS - \\dfrac{1}{2S^2} dS^2 + \\mathcal{O}(dS^3)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and we replace $dS = \\mu S dt + \\sigma S dW$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d\\ln{S} =  \\mu dt + \\sigma dW - \\dfrac{1}{2S^2} \\left( \\mu^2 S^2 dt^2 + 2 \\mu \\sigma S^2 dt dW + \\sigma^2 S^2 dW^2 \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Here, terms with $dt^2$ vanish faster than $dt$ and can be neglected. Similarly $dt dW \\propto dt \\sqrt{dt}$ and vanishes faster. However, for $dW^2$, we can look at the quadratic variation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "[W]_T = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} (\\Delta W_i)^2 = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}  (W((i+1)\\Delta t) - W(i \\Delta t))^2 = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\Delta t n \\left( \\dfrac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} Z_i^2\\right) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\Delta t n E[Z^2] = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\Delta t n = T < \\infty\n",
    "$$\n",
    "that means the quadratic variation is finite, and moreover $dW^2 = dt$, because $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} (\\Delta W)^2 = T = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sum\\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} \\Delta t$. Inserting this into our equation gives:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d\\ln{S} = (\\mu - \\dfrac{1}{2} \\sigma^2) dt + \\sigma dW\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which now can be integrated in the It么 sense to yield:\n",
