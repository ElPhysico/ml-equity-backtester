def buy_and_hold(px: pd.DataFrame, cost_bps: float = 0.0) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Equal-weight buy-and-hold:
    - On the first valid date (t0), identify tickers with prices at t0.
    - Allocate 1/N across those tickers and hold weights unchanged to the end.
    - Apply one-way cost_bps once at entry (embedded via first-day adjustment).

    Parameters
    ----------
    px : pd.DataFrame
        Daily close prices. Index: DatetimeIndex (tz-naive), ascending unique.
        Columns: ticker symbols. May contain NaNs; tickers without a price at t0
        are excluded from the initial portfolio.
    cost_bps : float, default 0.0
        One-way transaction cost in basis points charged once at portfolio entry.

    Returns
    -------
    pd.Series
        Daily equity curve (post-cost), index = trading dates from t0 onward,
        name = 'equity'.

    Notes
    -----
    - Weights are fixed after t0 (no rebalancing).
    - Entry cost is applied by scaling the equity on day 1 and resetting eq[t0] = 1.0,
      which effectively reduces the first dayâ€™s return by cost_bps.
    - Input is expected to be price-level data; internal normalization uses px / px.loc[t0].
    - Asserts at least one ticker has a finite price at t0.
